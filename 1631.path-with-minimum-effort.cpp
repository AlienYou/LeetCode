 *
 * You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given heights, a 2D
 * array of size rows x columns, where heights[row][col] represents the height
 * of cell (row, col). You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0), and you
 * hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1) (i.e.,
 * 0-indexed). You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a
 * route that requires the minimum effort.
 * 
 * A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two
 * consecutive cells of the route.
 * 
 * Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the
 * bottom-right cell.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2
 * in consecutive cells.
 * This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute
 * difference is 3.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: heights = [[1,2,3],[3,8,4],[5,3,5]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The route of [1,2,3,4,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 1
 * in consecutive cells, which is better than route [1,3,5,3,5].
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: heights =
 * [[1,2,1,1,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,1,1,2,1]]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: This route does not require any effort.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * rows == heights.length
 * columns == heights[i].length
 * 1 <= rows, columns <= 100
 * 1 <= heights[i][j] <= 10^6
 *
